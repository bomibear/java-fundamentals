## Overview of the Architecture
This is a library of Restaurant, Shops, Theaters and Reviews.

The restaurant, shop, and theater class allows restaurants, shops, and theaters to be instantiated.  

Reviews can be added for that restaurant, shop, and theater.  

Specifically, the review system for the theater is slightly different in that it allows a user to add a review with or without a movie name.

Additionally, the number of stars ratings for a restaurant will change based on the number of stars for each review.

Another way to test this is via a terminal of your choice.  ```cd``` into this repo after cloning it, and type in ```./gradlew test```.
