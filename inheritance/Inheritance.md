# Inheritance

## Overview of the Architecture
This is a library of Restaurant and Reviews.

The restaurant class allows restaurants to be instantiated.  

Reviews can be added for that restaurant, and that restaurant will have a list of reviews.  

Additionally, the number of stars ratings for that restaurant will change based on the number of stars for each review.
